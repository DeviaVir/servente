# servente

Manage Services like an SRE pro.

## Goals

The goal of Servente is to provide a platform for service-, or product- teams, or owners, to be a one-stop shop for managing service metadata.

Servente will be extensible with plugins for teams (owners), and service capabilities. All data is accessible via an API.

## SDK

When setting up API's to communicate between plugins we're using a common [SDK](https://github.com/DeviaVir/servente-sdk).

## Team plugins

* Google Workspace: [servente-teams-google-workspace](https://github.com/DeviaVir/servente-teams-google-workspace)
* more to follow via the community, hopefully :)
